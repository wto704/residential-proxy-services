The platform launched in late 2022 but quickly built credibility through first-party IP pools and transparent operations. Pricing starts at $1 per GB—among the most affordable options—with no expiration dates on purchased traffic. The anonymous filter toggle removes less-reliable IPs, and host blocking conserves bandwidth by filtering ads.

## FAQ

**What response times should I expect from residential proxies?**

Quality residential proxies typically deliver response times between 0.3 and 2 seconds depending on location and provider infrastructure. Geonode averages 500ms, making it suitable for time-sensitive scraping tasks. Faster isn't always better—extremely quick responses sometimes indicate datacenter IPs misrepresented as residential addresses.

**How does traffic expiration affect proxy costs?**

Some providers like Geonode, IPRoyal, and Rayobyte offer traffic that never expires, letting you buy in bulk and use bandwidth over months without waste. Others expire unused data monthly. For consistent usage, monthly plans often cost less per GB. For sporadic projects, non-expiring traffic prevents paying for bandwidth you don't use.

**Can residential proxies bypass CAPTCHAs automatically?**

Residential proxies significantly reduce CAPTCHA encounters because requests appear to come from real household connections rather than data centers. However, suspicious patterns—rapid requests, repeated actions, inconsistent fingerprints—still trigger challenges. Pairing residential IPs with proper session management and realistic behavior patterns delivers the best results.

## Conclusion

The residential proxy landscape keeps evolving, but a few things stay constant: you need reliable connections, genuine IP addresses, and pricing that makes sense for your projects. These twelve services deliver on those basics while offering different strengths depending on what you're building.

**[Geonode](https://geonode.com)** hits the sweet spot for most use cases—fast response times, solid success rates, and straightforward pricing starting at just $5 for 10GB. Whether you're scraping product data, managing accounts across platforms, or testing localized content, the combination of 99% success rates and 500ms response times handles everyday tasks without the premium price tags. The ethical sourcing, comprehensive country coverage, and simple setup make it practical for both new projects and scaling existing operations.
